Create an Application called “Online Exam System”.
When the application starts ask for Student Information, 
1)	Name
2)	Student ID (Numeric)
3)	Address
4)	Contact Number
5)	Email
For taking the examination, the student should be given 10 questions, with 4 option each, out of which one will be the correct answer. (Create your own questions)
Eg: 1) Who Created Java?
a)	Microsoft
b)	Google
c)	Sun Microsystems
d)	Amazon
The student answer will be ‘c’. 

Finally, when the exam is completed, you should display a final report.
